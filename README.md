# Machine-Learning-Classification-On-Factory-Dataset
Applications of multiple machine learning classification models on factory dataset

## About The Project
The project aims to create and finetune multiple classification models in sklearn to predict whether a machine willfail before it does, such that it can be replaced and does not interrupt production. The dataset consists of information regarding the machines, as well as their labels (target variable)

## OBJECTIVES
## â€Ž 
#### 1) How is prediction task defined? And what is the meaning of the output variable?
#### 2) How do you represent your data as features?
#### 3) Did you process the features in any way?
#### 4) How did you select which learning algorithms to use?
#### 5) Did you try to hypertune the parameters of the learning algorithm, and in that case how?
#### 6) How do you evaluate the quality of your system?
#### 7) How does your system compare to a stupid baseline?
#### 8) Can you say anything about the errors that the system makes?
#### 9) Is it possible to say something about which features the model considers important? (Whether this is possible depends on the type of classifier you are using)
